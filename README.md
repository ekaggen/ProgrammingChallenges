Programming Challenges
=====================

My solutions to some of the programming challenges problems (http://www.programming-challenges.com). A PDF of each problem is added alongside the solutions for reference.

Note that due to online judge limitations each solution could only be one file.

All of the solutions tend toward readablity over elegance. The assumption is made that program input follows supplied 	specifications. Handling of boundary cases outside of the specifications is omitted.

This is meant for fun, learning, and practice rather than for practical use! Code style reflects the purpose of the code.
